# Aims

Comprehend the models for flexure of the
<br>
oceanic lithosphere under the load of a seamount:

* The governing equation and it's solution by finite-differences
* How the flexure appears in gravity and bathymetry data

---

# Seamounts everywhere

<div class="container">
<div class="col-large tiny">

<img src="../assets/topography.png">

Topography and bathymetry map of the Earth according to the
[ETOPO1](https://doi.org/10.7289/V5C8276M) digital elevation model.
Seamounts are small dots away from mid-ocean ridges.

</div>
<div class="col-small small">

The sea floor is not smooth away from mid-ocean ridges (as predicted by cooling
models)

It is full of seamounts (small active or extinct volcanoes) and oceanic islands

Current estimates are between 10,000-100,000 seamounts globally

# Seamounts in gravity

Prominent features in gravity disturbance data (look at the West Pacific)

isostatic equilibrium

Try plotting Bouguer disturbances vs smoothed bathymetry around a seamount

# Flexure of an elastic plate

<div class="container">
<div class="col-large tiny">

<img src="../assets/flexure-seamount.svg">

$w$ = deflection,
$q(x)$ = force density of the load,
$g$ = gravity,
$E$ = Young's modulus,
$\nu$ = Poisson's ratio,
$T_e$ = effective elastic thickness,
$\rho_m$ = mantle density,
$\rho_w$ = water density

**Note on notation:** $w$ is the deflection from the normal plate depth,
**not** bathymetry.

</div>
<div class="col-small small">

1D flexure equation at equilibrium:

$ D\dfrac{\partial^4 w}{\partial x^4} = q - g (\rho_m - \rho_w) w $

<div style="margin-top: 15%;">

$D$ is the flexural rigidity, which reflects the physical properties of the
plate:

$D = \dfrac{E T_e^2}{12(1 - \nu^2)}$

</div>

# Boundary conditions

<div class="container">
<div class="col-large tiny">

<img src="../assets/flexure-seamount.svg">

$w$ = deflection,
$q(x)$ = force density of the load,
$g$ = gravity,
$E$ = Young's modulus,
$\nu$ = Poisson's ratio,
$T_e$ = effective elastic thickness,
$\rho_m$ = mantle density,
$\rho_w$ = water density

Assume that bending is happening under a finite load $q(x)$, i.e. it's
restricted to a finite domain of $x$

</div>
<div class="col-small small">

No deflection away from the load:

$w(x=0) = 0$

$w(x=x_{max}) = 0$

The plate is horizontal at the boundaries:

$\dfrac{\partial w}{\partial x}(x=0) = 0$

$\dfrac{\partial w}{\partial x}(x=x_{max}) = 0$

# Solution for the deflection

Write $w(x)$ in terms of measurable quantities:

* Position $x_0$ where deflection crosses the zero line

# Gravity disturbances

<div class="container">
<div class="col-large small">

gravity disturbance = observed gravity - normal (ellipsoid) gravity

This means that the density anomalies causing the observed disturbance are:

Real Earth densities - Normal Earth densities

Assume that the ellipsoid is layered (including an ocean)

Density anomalies at subduction zones üëâüèΩ

# Predicting gravity

<div class="container">
<div class="col-left tiny">

<img src="../assets/disturbance-subduction-model.svg">

Model of density anomalies due to subduction. Anomalies are real Earth density
minus normal Earth density.

Assumptions: density contrast between lithosphere-asthenosphere mantle is
negligible, the crust has constant thickness, bending at the surface is equal
to bending at the Moho.

</div>
<div class="col-right small">

Once again, we can model the gravitational attraction of the deflection with
the Bouguer plate approximation:

$ g_{w} = 2 \pi G \Delta\rho_{top} w + 2 \pi G \Delta\rho_{bottom} w $

$\Delta\rho_{top} = \rho_c - \rho_w$ if $w > 0$

$\Delta\rho_{top} = \rho_w - \rho_c$ if $w < 0$

$\Delta\rho_{bottom} = \rho_m - \rho_c$ if $w > 0$

$\Delta\rho_{bottom} = \rho_c - \rho_m$ if $w < 0$

</div>
</div>

# Does it fit the data?

We can now predict gravity disturbances and bathymetry caused by the deflection
of the lithosphere across subduction zones.

In the associated **practical** activity, we will implement the corresponding
equations in Python and evaluate how well our model fits the available data
along profiles.
