    "Using the 1D flexure equation, we can model the bending of the oceanic lithosphere at a subduction zone. **Our assumption is that the plate is perfectly elastic and is bending under a load placed at one of its ends.** The solution for the amount of deflection (upwards or downwards) $w$ can be expressed as:\n",
