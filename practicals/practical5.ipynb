    "**Goal:** Bring together all that we've learned so far to investigate the state of the lithosphere is different parts of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've learned how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assess the overall state of isostatic equilibrium of the lithosphere using topography/bathymetry and gravity data\n",
    "1. Model the thermal evolution of the oceanic lithosphere and compare model predictions against heat flow and bathymetry data\n",
    "1. Model the bending of the lithosphere at subduction zones and make predictions of bathymetry and gravity disturbances along profiles\n",
    "1. Model the intra-plate bending of the lithosphere under the weight of oceanic islands and seamounts and compare model predictions against observed gravity disturbances\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Investigate a particular region of the Earth using global topography/bathymetry, age, heat flow, and gravity data\n",
    "1. Use all of the tools available to you to describe the overall state of the lithosphere (isostic equilibrium, flexure, thickness, age, fit to models, etc)\n",
    "1. Work in groups to come up with a summary of your understanding of the lithosphere in that particular region"

    "The data grids are stored in a [netCDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetCDF) file, which is a very common standard for storing and distributing gridded data. It's used throughout the Earth, ocean, and climate sciences and can be read an manipulated with most software platforms. It contains global grids of gravity, topography, and heat flow. All grids were interpolated onto the same resolution of 0.2 degrees (a compromise between resolution and size of the file) so that we can easily compare and use all of the data together.\n",

    "* **Gravity**: generated from the [EIGEN-6C4 spherical harmonic model](https://doi.org/10.5880/icgem.2015.1) through the [ICGEM webservice](http://icgem.gfz-potsdam.de/home). It includes two grids: the gravity disturbance calculated with the WGS84 ellipsoid and the Bouguer gravity disturbance calculated using a topography density of 2670 kg/m³. The data for both grids was generated on top of the Earth's surface (the water surface in the oceans and topography on land).\n",
    "* **Topography and bathymetry**: a downsampled version of [ETOPO1](https://doi.org/10.7289/V5C8276M) and includes a version smoothed using a Gaussian filter with 1 degree width (~100 km).\n",

    "* **Lithosphere age (oceanic)**: a downsampled version of the grid by [Müller et al. (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2007GC001743) (originally 6 arc-minutes)."
