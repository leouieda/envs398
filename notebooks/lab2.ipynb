The term $(\\rho_m - \\rho_w) g w$ is the restoring hydrostatic force (buoyancy) from replacing mantle material at depth with water on top because of the flexure.\n",

    "\n",
    "The **load force per unit area** $q(x)$ is the weight of the load applied on the lithosphere. For a load of height $h$ and density $\\rho_c$, the weight per unit area is (negative because the force is applied downwards):\n",
